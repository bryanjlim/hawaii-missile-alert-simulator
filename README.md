# hawaii-missile-alert-simulator

A simulation of the user interface behind the false Hawaii missile alert... With some additional tweaks.

Uses ReactJS and contains a set of poorly-designed user interface scenarios where one must try to go through the scenarios to activate the test alarm without setting of the actual one. If you set off the actual one by accident, you have to start all the scenarios over again.

Designed to promote political activism and the maintenence of government systems (which should have usable UIs).
